            <p>
                It doesn’t matter how many companies you’ve built, how many products you’ve shipped, or how many late
                nights you’ve survived chasing a vision that once existed only in your head. <span
                    class="highlight-word">The voice is always there.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                It shows up quietly at first. A small hesitation before you hit “send.” A pause before you speak in a
                meeting. A moment where you wonder how long it will be before someone notices that you’re improvising
                more than you’d like to admit.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Remember one morning with painful clarity.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                We were about to launch our Series B announcement. The TechCrunch article was scheduled for 8:00 AM
                sharp. My team was celebrating in Slack—rocket emojis, gifs, inside jokes that only make sense when
                you’ve been through something hard together. From the outside, it looked like momentum. Success. Proof.

                But I was sitting alone in my kitchen, staring at a mug of coffee that had already gone cold.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>"They're going to find out,"</em> a voice whispered. <em>"They're going to realize I have no idea
                    what I'm doing."</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                This feeling isn't unique to me. In fact, if you’re a founder, a creator, or anyone swerving out of
                their lane to build something new, you probably know this voice intimately.
                We call it <span class="highlight-word">Imposter Syndrome</span>, but that label feels too clinical for
                something so visceral. It feels like
                fear. It feels like you’re a child wearing your parent's oversized suit.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "The only way to not feel like an imposter is to stop doing meaningful work."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Why It Happens</h2>
            <p>
                We often mistake confidence for competence. We assume that the "experts" don't feel doubt. But after
                talking to dozens of founders—people running billion-dollar companies—I’ve realized something startling:
                <span class="highlight-word">The doubt never goes away.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                It doesn't go away because the nature of our work is to step into the unknown. You are literally doing
                things you have never done before, every single day.
                If you felt completely confident, it would mean you aren't growing. You’d be staying in your comfort
                zone. This discomfort is often called "growing pains" in other contexts, but when it affects our
                professional identity, we label it as fraudulence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Psychologists suggest that high achievers are particularly susceptible. The very traits that make you
                ambitious—perfecionism, introspection, and high standards—are the same ones that fuel the imposter
                cycle. You dismiss your success as luck and your failures as proof of incompetence.
            </p>

            <h2>The Comparison Trap</h2>
            <p>
                In the age of social media, we are constantly bombarded with the highlight reels of others. We see their
                funding announcements, their polished product launches, and their "humble"brags. We rarely see the 3 AM
                panic attacks, the failed negotiations, or the bugs that took down prod.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comparing your internal blooper reel to someone else's external highlight reel is a recipe for disaster.
                Everyone is fighting a hard battle you know nothing about. That confident CEO you admire? They are
                likely looking at someone else and thinking, "I wish I had it together like them."
            </p>

            <h2>Reframing the Narrative</h2>
            <p>
                So, how do we deal with it? We don't "beat" imposter syndrome. We make friends with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When that voice speaks up, instead of spiraling, I try to pause and say, <em>"Oh, hello. You're here
                    because I'm about to do something brave."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                It changes the dynamic. The fear is no longer a signal to stop; it's a signal that I'm on the right
                track.
                It means the stakes are real. It means I care. It means I am pushing the boundaries of my current
                capabilities.
            </p>

            <h2>Practical Steps to Ground Yourself</h2>
            <p>
                Over the years, I’ve developed a few tactics to keep the imposter monster in check:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep a "Hype Doc":</strong> Create a document where you screenshot nice emails, record small
                    wins, and track successful projects. Read it when you feel low.</li>
                <li><strong>Talk About It:</strong> <span class="highlight-word">Vulnerability is a superpower.</span>
                    When I admitted my fear to my
                    co-founder, he exhaled and said, "Thank god, I thought I was the only one."</li>
                <li><strong>Separate Feelings from Facts:</strong> You can feel stupid and still be doing a great job.
                    Feelings are real, but they aren't always true.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To anyone reading this who feels like they are faking it: You aren't. <span class="highlight-word">You
                    are just learning.</span> And the
                only true imposters are the ones who pretend they have nothing left to learn.
